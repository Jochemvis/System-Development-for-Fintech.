    "In this part of the assignment, we are tasked with calculating fraud risks in a number of patterns in transactions. In total, we wat to base our risk assessment on 7 metrics: round amount payments, payments from high risk countries, smurfing, nesting, transactions that are non-adherence to FATF recommendation 16, transcactions from shell companies and traded based money laundring. To assess the risk of these various topics, we decided to calculate the risks of each individual topic as well as for the total cumulative risk per transaction. Each risk assessment is appended to the dataframe we created based on the swift messages. This enables intrested parties to set their own risk thresholds for individual and total risk calculations. So can stakeholders that are intrested in smurfing set a threshold of 0.7 in the corresponding column to research transaction that have a high smurfing risk score and stakeholders that are intrested in total risk set a threshold for the total risk column (for example at 4.5) to filter out transaction that have a high total risk score."

    "The decision to adjust the thresholds for round amount payments in the code is based on the principles discussed in the article \"Round numbers: A fingerprint of fraud\" by B.M.J. Nigrini, PhD, published in the Journal of Accountancy in May 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the article, Nigrini explains how fraudsters often manipulate financial data by using round numbers, which can serve as a \"fingerprint\" of fraudulent activities. Round numbers are frequently used in financial statement fraud, occupational fraud, and bribery schemes to make fraudulent numbers appear more believable or to cover up irregularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify potential instances of fraud, Nigrini suggests analyzing transaction amounts that are exact multiples of specific round numbers. These round numbers are often associated with fraudulent activities because they are easier to fabricate and may not reflect the natural distribution of legitimate financial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this literature, the decision to set the thresholds in the code is guided by the need to capture amounts commonly associated with fraudulent activities. By setting the thresholds at values commonly found in fraudulent transactions, such as multiples of 1000, 500, and 250, the code aims to identify potential instances of fraud in the dataset, aligning with the principles discussed in Nigrini's article. In the article, transaction values that can be divided by 1000 are seen as most suspicious. After that, fractions of 1000 are seen as suspicious, such as 500 and 250 (Nigirni, 2018). Therefore, it is decided to calculate a risk score according to this ranking."

    "In our analysis, we utilized various sources to compile lists of countries categorized by their financial secrecy and tax haven status. Firstly, we referred to the \"Black and Grey\" lists provided by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These lists contain countries identified as having deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. From this source, we extracted countries categorized as either blacklisted or greylisted. Blacklisted countries include those with significant deficiencies, while greylisted countries have made a commitment to address deficiencies but are yet to fully implement necessary reforms (FATF, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we consulted the Corporate Tax Haven Index 2021 published by the Tax Justice Network. This index ranks countries based on their level of financial secrecy and their role as tax havens. Countries with high secrecy scores are considered to facilitate financial opacity and potentially enable tax avoidance and evasion (Tax Justice Network, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining information from these sources, we categorized countries into three groups: blacklisted, greylisted, and ranked by their secrecy score. Unfortunately, due to limitations in data availability, we had to manually compile the secrecy scores for each country, as the Tax Justice Network's data portal was undergoing maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then calculated the risk score based on the the risk of the originating country, which can either be blacklisted, greylisted or unlisted. Then we multiplied this with secrecy score devided by 100, so we can once again get a risk value between 0-1."

    "We based our smurfing risk calculator on three aspects that were found by Joseph Ibitola (2023). He explored the deceptive strategy of breaking down large sums of illicit funds into smaller transactions to evade detection and circumvent anti-money laundering regulations. The calculator assesses various factors including the frequency of transactions within a 24-hour window, transaction amounts below a certain threshold, and the geographical spread of the transactions. By incorporating these criteria, the risk calculator aims to identify transactions exhibiting characteristics commonly associated with smurfing (Ibitola, 2023), thereby enabling financial institutions to prioritize monitoring and investigation efforts effectively in combating this form of financial crime. Frequent transactions between the same people over a short period of time (24 hours) is considered the biggest indicator of fraud and is therefore awarded a higher risk score then the other two factors.
