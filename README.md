## Sub-assignment 1 Semi-supervised learning:

In this assignment, we apply the same models as described in the study by Alarab, I., Prakoonwit, S., & Nacer, M. I. (2020, June) in their paper "Comparative analysis using supervised learning methods for anti-money laundering in bitcoin". However, unlike the research where unlabeled data was discarded, we choose to utilize this unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning techniques. This allows us to enhance the performance of our models by leveraging not only the available labeled data but also extracting value from the unlabeled data. The specific approach and results of employing semi-supervised learning in this context are extensively documented in the file.

## Sub-assignment 2 SWIFT: 

A Python script is developed to convert SWIFT messages into a structured dataframe. SWIFT messages are analyzed, and key information such as sender, receiver, amount, currency, value date, reference, and any remarks are extracted and transformed into a dataframe. After converting the SWIFT messages, risk analyses are conducted. These analyses may include various aspects, such as detecting suspicious transaction patterns, identifying potential compliance issues, or assessing financial risks associated with the transactions. The goal of this assignment is to create an automated process that is flexible and capable of handling various types of SWIFT messages. The script should be able to extract relevant information from the messages and subsequently perform risk analyses to ensure the integrity and compliance of the financial transactions. For further details and comprehensive steps, please refer to the document.
